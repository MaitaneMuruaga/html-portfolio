<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Maitane Muruaga and I studied journalism at the University of the Basque Country. I have done journalism internships for 1 year in different media outlets until last year an opportunity crossed my path that I couldn't miss: being a UX/UI designer in a public company.</p>

<p>There I discovered a world that I had never delved into but that finally ended up hooking me: programming. Since then I have taken several courses in which I have learned HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript.</p>

<p>Currently I am continuing my training in the world of programming, learning the JavaScript language in depth. Always keeping in mind the career I want to follow: UX/UI designer.</p>
